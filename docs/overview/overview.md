# Overview

**SGL** is a Graph Neural Network (GNN) toolkit targeting scalable graph learning, which supports deep graph learning on extremely large datasets. SGL allows users to easily implement scalable graph neural networks and evaluate its performance on various downstream tasks like node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. Further, SGL supports auto neural architecture search functionality based on <a href="https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/open-box" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OpenBox</a>. SGL is designed and developed by the graph learning team from the <a href="https://cuibinpku.github.io/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DAIR Lab</a> at Peking University.
